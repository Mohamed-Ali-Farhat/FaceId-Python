# Image Recognition Project

This project focuses on image recognition using Python, with a special emphasis on the OpenCV library (cv2). The primary functionality revolves around face recognition, and the main components of the project are organized in separate files.

## Files

### 1. simple_facerec.py
This file contains the core functionality of the image recognition system. Here's an overview of the functions:

- **load_encoding_images:** Loads images from the "images" folder for encoding.
- **detect_unknown_faces:** Implements the face detection function using OpenCV.

### 2. image_comparison.py
This file serves as a test suite for the encoding functions. It includes tests to validate the functionality of the encoding process.

### 3. main.py
The main file that orchestrates the entire image recognition process. It integrates the functions from simple_facerec.py to perform the complete recognition workflow.

## Usage

To utilize this project, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your machine.
2. Install the required dependencies, including OpenCV, with this command:
   ```bash
   pip install opencv-python
3.Run main.py to initiate the image recognition process.
